# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

## Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `python-api-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**. When you create the repo, be sure you create a `.gitignore` file for Python. 

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside the repository folder you just created, add new files called `WeatherPy.ipynb` and `VacationPy.ipynb`. (It may be easiest to launch a Jupyter notebook from within your local repo and create these files that way.) These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub.


### Adding A .gitignore File

We don't want the `api_keys.py` file containing the API key to be exposed to the public on GitHub, as this would mean anyone could copy and use our API key, possibly causing us to incur charges.

When we type `git status` in the command line, we can see all the files we have created so far that are untracked.

If we only wanted to add the `WeatherPy.ipynb` file to GitHub we could type `git add WeatherPy.ipynb`. However, every time we want to add a new file or update current files to the repository, we have to add each file individually, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. Instead, we can add the files we don't want to track to the `.gitignore` file.

Before we add our files to GitHub, let's add `api_keys.py` to the `.gitignore` file. Follow these steps:

1. Open your `python-api-challenge` GitHub folder in VS Code.

2. Open the `.gitignore` file, and on the first line type the following:

```python
# Adding config.py file.
api_keys.py
```

3. While the `.gitignore` file is open, add the `API_practice.ipynb` and `random_numbers.ipynb` files and save the file.

4. In the command line, type `git status` and press Enter. The output should say the `.gitignore` file has been modified and the `WeatherPy.ipynb` file is untracked.

5. Use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to commit the modifications to `.gitignore` and the `WeatherPy.ipynb` file to GitHub.

On GitHub, the only new file you should see is the `WeatherPy.ipynb` file.


## Part I - WeatherPy

In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot, add a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing.

The second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots, take the time to explain what the linear regression is modeling. For example, describe any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have.

Your final notebook must:

* Randomly select **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

### Part II - VacationPy

Now let's use your skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.

* **Note:** Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credit will be charged to your personal account. You can set quotas and limits to your daily requests to be sure you can't be charged. Check out [Google Maps Platform Billing](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing/gmp-billing#monitor-and-restrict-consumption) and [Manage your cost of use](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage-and-billing#set-caps) for more information.

* **Note:** if you having trouble displaying the maps, try running `jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps` in your environment and retry.

To complete this part of the assignment,you will need to do the following:

* Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I.

  ![heatmap]

* Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.

  * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.

  * **Note:** Feel free to adjust to your specifications but be sure to limit the number of rows returned by your API requests to a reasonable number.

* Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.
